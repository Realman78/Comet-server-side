# Comet-server-side
The fastest way to send files from your phone to your PC.  
As soon as you upload images through the phone, a timer that lasts 5 minutes starts. After the 5 minutes, images are deleted from the server and are no longer accessible.  
**Disclaimer**: No styling added yet for android  


**Phone** - Select the files you wish to upload and you will be provided with a 6-digit code.

**PC** - Those files are then automatically downloaded to your PC upon arriving on *url/{code}*.
